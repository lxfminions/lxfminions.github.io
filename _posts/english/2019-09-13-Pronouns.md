A pronoun is a word that takes the place of one or more nouns. It can do all of the things that nouns can do. 'pro' means "on behalf of".

An ***antecedent*** is the noun that a pronoun is replacing or refering to.

### Personal Pronouns

| Personal Pronouns | Singular              | Plural     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| First Person      | I, me                 | we, us     |
| Second Person     | you                   | you        |
| Third Person      | she, her, he, him, it | they, them |

### Relative Pronouns

| Relative Pronouns                                            | Lists                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| These relate subordinate adjective clauses to the rest of the sentence | that, which, who, whose, whichever, whatever, whomever, whoever |

### Demonstrative Pronouns
There are only four demonstrative pronouns. We use them to point out particular people or things.

| Demonstrative Pronouns             | Singular | Plural |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Refers to things that are nearby   | this     | these  |
| Refers to things that are far away | that     | those  |

### Indefinite Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns do not refer to a definite or specific person or thing. We don't know whom or what these refer to!

|                    | Indefinite Pronouns                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Singular           | anybody, anyone, anything, each, either, everybody, everyone, everything, neither, nobody, no one, nothing, one, somebody, someone, something |
| Plural             | both, few, many, several                                     |
| Singular or Plural | all, any, most, none, some                                   |

{% include warning.html content="When indefinite pronouns are used before nouns, they are actually acting as adjectives, not pronouns." %}

### Reflexive Pronouns
A **reflexive pronoun** is used to refer to the subject of the sentence.

An **intensive pronoun** is used to emphasize another noun or pronoun. They are alse called **emphatic appositives**. That means that they do not need to refer to the subject. They can refer to any old noun or pronoun in the sentence.

For exmple, "*I will go to school* ***myself***.", the bold word ***myself*** refers to the subject **I** of the sentence. But "*He* ***himself*** *visited the school*" emphasizes the subject - He.

| Reflexive Pronouns | Singular                 | Plural     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| First Person       | myself                   | ourselves  |
| Second Person      | yourself                 | yourselves |
| Third Person       | himself, herself, itself | themselves |

### Interrogative Pronouns
These are pronouns that are found in **questions**. Another name for a question is an **interrogative sentence**.

| Interrogative Pronouns          |                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| These are used to ask questions | what, who, which, whom, whose |

### Possessive Pronouns

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

### Subject and Object Pronouns
