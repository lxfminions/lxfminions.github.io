## What Is A Pronoun
A **pronoun** is a word that takes the place of a noun. *pro* means "on behalf
of".

### Antecedents
An **antecedent** is the noun that a pronoun is replacing or refering to.
### Types of Pronouns
#### Personal Pronouns
| Personal pronouns | Singular | Plural |
|-------------------|----------|--------|
| First Person: The person or people speaking or writing | I me | we us |
| Second Person: The person or people being spoken or written to | you | you |
| Third Person: The person, people, or things being spoken or written about |
| she, her, he, him, it | they, them |

#### Demonstrative Pronouns
They are only four demonstrative pronouns. We use them to point out particular
people or things.

<span style="align:center">**this, that, these, those**</span>

Sometimes, those words are used before nouns. In those cases, they are adjectives, not pronouns.

#### Relative Pronouns
**Relative pronouns** are words that introduce adjective clauses.

<span style="align: center;">**who, whom, whose, that, which**</span>

**Relative adverbs** can also introduce adjective clauses.

#### Indefinite Pronouns
**Indefinite pronouns** do not refer to a denifinte or specific person or thing.

The prefix **in-** means **not**. **Indefinite pronouns** are **not** definite.
We don't know whom or what these refer to!

**one, someone, anyone, something, everything, both, many, all, most, some,
several, few, none, much**

##### Antecedents?
**Antecedents** are the words that pronouns refer to, and these pronouns do not
usually have antecedents.

But there are exceptions.

#### Reflexive & Intensive Pronouns
These two types of pronouns end in **-self** or **-selves**.

**himself, herself, myself, itself, yourself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves**

Those words have different names depending on how they are being used.

A **reflexive pronoun** is used to refer to the subject of the sentence.

I will go to school **myself**. (reflexive)

An **intensive pronoun** is used to emphasize another noun.

He **himself** visited the school. (intensive)

##### What Are Reflexive Pronouns?
**Reflexive pronouns** are objects that refer to the *subject*.
##### What Are Intensive Pronouns?
**Intensive pronouns** are used to emphasize another noun or pronoun. They are
also called ***emphatic appositives***.

That means that they do not need to refer to the subject. They can refer to any
old noun or pronoun in the sentence.

### Interrogative Pronouns
These are pronouns that are found in **questions**. Another name for a question
is an ***interrogative sentence***. Interrogative pronouns often begin interrogative sentences.

**what, whom, whose, who, which**

### Possessive Pronouns
**Possessive pronouns** show ownership.

**his, hers, your, theirs**
