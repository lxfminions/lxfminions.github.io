## Learn the Parts of Speech
### Nouns
**Nouns** are words that name people, places, things, or ideas.

There are many different types of nouns.

Here are a few: proper nouns, common nouns, collective nouns, possessive nouns,
countable or uncountable nouns, abstract or concrete nouns, singular or plural,
and compound.
#### Collective Nouns
**Collective nouns** refer to groups of people, animals, or things. They are
one of the categories of nouns.
##### Singular or Plural?
*Singular* means one. *Plural* means more than one.
> These nouns can be singluar or plural depending on the context of the sentence. They're usually singular.
They are usually **singular** because they focus on the individual elements
actiong together as one unit. In these cases, use a singular verb to match the
singular subject.
```plain
The team is winning! (Team is seen as one unit)
```

They can also be **plural**. When the sentence is highlighting the individuals
among the group, the noun is plural. In these cases, use a plural verb to match
the plural subject.
```plain
The team are cooperating well tonight. (Team is seen as many individuals)
```
#### Possessive Nouns
These show ownership. **Dad's** car, the **student's** book.

**Possessive nouns function as adjectives.**

and can still be modified by adjectives, i.e. it still is a noun." %}

### Verbs
A **verb** is a word that expresses an action or a state of being.

As you can see from that definition, there are two main categories of verbs:
**action verbs** and state of being verbs (also known as **linking verbs**).

Because action verbs and linking verbs are strong enough to be used in sentences all by themselves, they are called *main verbs*.

I **love** cheese. I **turned** the page. (action verbs)

I **am** a teacher. I **turned** green. (linking verbs)

There is also a third category of verbs which doesn't get any glory. They are
the **helping verbs**. The reason that these guys don't get any of the fame
that action and linking verbs get is because they *don't stand alone* as main
verbs.
#### Helping Verbs
The **helping verb(s)** and the main verb come together to form a
**verb phrase**. Here is a list of 24 common helping verbs.

| be | am | is | are |
|----|----|----|-----|
| was | were | been | being |
| have | has | had | could |
| should | would | may | might |
| must | shall | can | will |
| do | did | does | having |

#### Action Verbs
Keep in mind that *action* doesn't always mean *movement*.
##### Transitive Active
Certain action verbs called *transitive active verbs* transfer action to some-
thing called a direct object.
```plain
Joe kicked the ball. Jim ate the cake.
```
Kicked and ate are transitive active verbs. Ball and cake are direct objects.
##### Transitive Passive 
This type of action verb transfers its action to the subject.
```plain
My car was stolen. The house was demolished.
```
##### Intransitive Complete
```plain
I screamed. The dog barked.
```
This type of action verb does not transfer action to anyone or anything.
#### Linking Verbs
**Linking verbs** show states of being.
```plain
Sunny feels happy.
Elizabeth is a teacher.
Ron Swanson is the manager of the office.
```
Feels, is, and is are all verbs tell us about the state of the subjects (Sunny,
Elizabeth, Ron Swanson).

These verbs function as equals signs between the subject and a noun or adjective.
```plain
Sunny = happy
Elizabeth = teacher
Ron Swanson = manager
```

A **linking verb** is a verb that links the subject with either a noun that
renames it (predicate nominative) or an adjective that describes it (predicate
adjective).
##### List of Verbs Linking Verbs
You can call these either **linking verbs** or *intransitive linking verbs*.

| Forms of be | be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Other Linking Verbs | appear, become, feel, grow, look, seem, remain, smell,
sound, stay, taste, trun |

##### Predicate Nominatives
A **predicate nominative** (or predicate noun) is just a fancy name for the
noun that comes after a linking verb and renames the subject.

Here are some examples for you. The predicate nouns are in bold.

1. Elizabeth <u>is</u> a **teacher**.
2. Mike <u>might be</u> **president** of the club.
3. Jolene <u>was</u> a **runner**.

##### Predicate Adjectives
**Predicate adjectives** are just adjectives that come after linking verbs and
describe the subject. Here are some examples for you. The predicate adjectives
are in bold.
1. Sunny <u>feels</u> **happy**.
2. Dan <u>seemed</u> **sad** after the game.
3. Marge <u>grew</u> **tired** during the concert.

*Happy* is a predicate adjective describing Sunny, *sad* is a predicate
adjective describing Dan, and *tired* is a predicate adjective describing
Marge.


### Adverbs
**Adverbs** modify (describe) **verbs**, **adjectives**, and other **adverbs**.
#### What is an adverb? The adverb questions will help you understand.
1. How? (happily, really, quite, peacefully...)
2. When? (tomorrow, now, yesterday, never...)
3. Where? (here, there, everywhere...)
4. To what extent? (very, so, too, quite, rather...)
5. Why? (because he wanted soup)

### Prepositions
**Prepositions** are words that show the relationship between a **noun** or
**pronoun** and some other word or element in the rest of the **sentence**.
#### Examples
##### She swam **across** the lake
**Across** connects the noun **lake** with the verb **swam**. It tells us where
she **swam**.
##### The cupcake **with** sprinkles is mine
In this example, the preposition **with** is showing the relationship between
the noun **sprinkles** and the noun **cupcake**. It tells us which **cupcake**
is hers.
#### Prepositional Phrases
A **prepositional phrase** consists of a preposition plus a noun or pronoun (of
the **object of the preposition**).
{% include tip.html content="we can jazz up prepositional phrases by adding
**adjectives** and **adverbs**." %}
All of the words in a prepositional phrase come together to function as an
adjective or adverb.

### What is a conjunction?
A **conjunction** is a word that joins two or more words, **phrases**, or
**clauses**.
- **Words**: *silver* **and** *gold*
- **Phrases**: *over the river* **and** *through the woods
- **Clauses**: *Marianne planted a flower*, **and** *she watched it grow*.

All conjunctions perform the same basic function (gluing things together), but
there are three types of conjunctions, and you'll be learning about them next!
1. **Coordinating Conjunctions**
2. **Subordinating Conjunctions**
3. **Correlative Conjunctions**
