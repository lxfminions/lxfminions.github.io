## Phi
1. Mathematical concepts build on simpler mathematical concepts.
2. **abstract**: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or
concrete existence.
3. The guiding principle in generalizing a mathematical concept is to take care
that everything that was true before the generalization remains true. In other
words, wo want everything to be consistent.

## Number System
1. Nature Numbers
2. Integer Numbers, i.e. it is a 'whole or entire number'.
3. Rational Numbers, ratio or fraction (parts of whole number)
4. Real Numbers
### Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are numbers of the form
$$ z = a + bi $$
where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the square root of negative $1$,
i.e.,
$$ i^2 = -1 $$.
The symbol $i$ is called the *imaginary* unit.

## Fundamental Operation
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication: `multiplicand $\times$ multiplier`
4. Division: `divisor / dividend = quotient + remainder`

## Famous Equations and Inequations
### Mathematics
#### Mathematical Contants.
$ e^{i\pi} = -1 $
#### The difinition of Pi
$ \pi = \frac{c}{d} $ Pi is defined to be that ratio of the circumference $c$
of any circle divided by its diameter, d.
#### The definition of $e$
$ e = \lim_{n \to \infty}(1 + \frac{1}{n})^n $ One way of defining Euler's
number $e$ is by this formular.
#### A differential equation
$ \frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x $ A more mathematical definition of $e$ is obtained by
asking which function $f$ equals its own derivative.
#### The Pythagorean Theorem
$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
#### The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
$ \frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(s)\,ds = f(x) $ This foumula expresses the fact that
differentiation and integration are inverse operations of each other.

### Physics
#### Energy, mass, and the speed of light
$ E = mc^2 $ Einstein's famous equations says that mass $m$ is equivalent to
energy $E$, and the amount of energy contained in a piece of mass is equal to
the mass multiplied with the square of the speed of light.
#### Gravity
$ F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{d^2} $ If you have two objects of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ at
a distance $d$, then these two objects will attract each other with a force
$F$ given in this formula. $G$ is the gravitational constant. It equals
approximately $ 6.67 \times 10^{-11} N \cdot m^2 \cdot {kg}^{-2} $. This
formula determines the destiny of our Universe.
