***Sentences*** are nice little package of words that come together to express complete thoughts.

***Clauses*** are groups of words with a subject and a verb. There are two main types: independent and dependent.

***Independent*** can stand alone because they express complete thoughts.

***Subordinate / Dependent*** can't stand alone because they don't express complete thoughts. All of the words come together to act as an *adjective*, *adverb*, or *noun*. So we can divide these into categories based on what part of speech they function as. When we do this, we get three categories.

- ***Adjective Clause*** a dependent clause that functions as an adjective.
- ***Adverb Clause*** a dependent clause that functions as an adverb.
- ***Noun Clause*** a dependent clause that functions as a noun.

## The Four Sentence Structures

### Simple Sentences

A simple sentence contains only one independent clause.

### Compound Sentences

A compound sentence contains at least two independent clauses. These clauses are joined by a coordinating **conjunction** or a semicolon.

### Complex Sentences

A complex sentence contains a subordinate clause and an independent clause.

### Compound-Complex Sentences

These are basically a combination of compound sentences and complex sentences. They contain at least two independent clauses and at least one subordinate clause.
