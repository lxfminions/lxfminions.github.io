## What Are Verbs
**Verbs** are words that express actions or states of being.

As you can see from that definition, there are two main categories of verbs:
**action verbs** and ***state of being*** verbs (also known as **linking verbs**. They are also called **main verbs**. **Main** means that the verb is
strong enough to be the only verb in the sentence.

But there is also a third category of verbs called **helping verbs**, because
they do *not stand alone* as main verbs.

There are three categories of verbs (action, linking, helping).

### The Four Verb Types
Now focus on main verbs (i.e. **action verbs** and **linking verbs**).

These two kinds of main verbs can act in four different ways.
#### Intransitive Complete Verbs
This type of verb does not transfer its action to anyone or anything.

#### Transitive Active Verbs
These action verbs transfer their action to someone or something.

The receiver of the action in this kind of verb is called the **direct object**.

#### Transitive Passive Verbs
These verbs also show action, and they also transfer their action to a receiver.

In transitive active verbs, the receiver was the direct object.

In transitive passive verbs, the receiver of the action is the subject!

#### Intransitive Linking
Linking verbs tell us about the **state** or **condition** of the subject.

They link the subject of a sentence with either *a noun that renames the subject* or *an adjective that describes the subject*.

Nouns that rename the subject are called ***predicate nouns***.

Adjectives that describe the subject are called ***predicate adjectives***.

### Helping Verbs
**Helping verbs** (auxiliary verbs) do just what their name implies. They
***help*** the main verb in the sentence by telling more about the verb's **tense**, **mood**, and **voice**.

## Tense of Verbs

## Voice of Verbs
The "voice" that a verb is written in tell us whether the subject is performing
the action (active) or receiving tha action (passive).

action verbs in these sentences. (That means that linking verbs are off the table, folks.)" %}
