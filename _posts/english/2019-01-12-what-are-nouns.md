They are usually **sigular** because they focus on the individual elements
actiong together as one unit.

They can also be **plural**. When the sentence is highlighting *the individuals
among the group*, the noun is *plural*.

**Possessive nouns** are nouns that show ownership. It functions as **adjectives**.

Even though they function as adjectives, they maintain some of their "noun-ness" and can still be modified by adjectives.
