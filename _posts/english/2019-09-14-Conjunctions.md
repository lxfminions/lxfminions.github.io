A conjunction is a word that joins two or more words, phrases, or clauses.

**Clauses** are groups of words with a subject and a verb. They are two main types:

independent that can stand alone and express complete thoughts and dependent not.

## Types of Conjunctions

### Coordinating Conjunctions

It connects similar words together.

There are only seven of these.

***for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so***

Some people remember these with the acronym **FANBOYS**.

### Subordinating Conjunctions

These conjunctions glue *dependent adverb clauses* to *independent clauses*. A dependent adverb clause is group of words with a subject and a verb that functions as a single adverb. There are introduced by subordinating conjunctions.

It connects two ideas with one more important than the other.

### Correlative Conjunctions

Correlative conjunctions are used in pairs (*either...or, both...and*), but they have the same function as coordinating conjunctions.

It connects similar groups of words together, but always come in pairs.
