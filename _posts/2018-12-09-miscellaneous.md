## [Imperial units](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18473014)
  1. Length
    - `1 foot = 12 inches`---base 12. It can be easily divided into 4ths, 3rd,
  and 2nds. Base 10 can only easily be divided into 2nds.
    - `1 inch` equivalent to `2.54cm` in the metric units --- an easily identifiable unit of measure for smallish things. About the width of my thumb.
  2. Temperature
    In imperial units: 0 = REALLY cold. 100 = REALLY hot. 50 = somewhere in the middle. Put on a sweater, but not dangerous. 100 = about the temperature of a human body.
    Water boils at 212F and freezes at 32F. There are 180 degrees between freezing and boiling.
