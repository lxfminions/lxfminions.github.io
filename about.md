Hi! Glad to see you here. I'm [Lxfminions](https://lxfminions.github.io). My
Chinese name is Liu Xiaofei, and I love [Minions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minions_(film)) very much, so the first three letters in my English name is my Chinese initials. I used this site for my personal note taking. The language I use in this site is mainly in English but sometimes I use Chinese.

Notes in this site are only for me, you thus don't understand what the hell I
wrote sometimes. If you need to understand more or want me to explain something
to you, don't hestitate to ask me by sending email---xiaofei1356@gamil.com
or submitting a issue on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lxfminions/lxfminions.github.io).

My English is really not so good (I think you can see it), but I am willing to
improve continuously. Please let me know if there are some errors.

PS. I use [**NoteTheme**](https://github.com/dinhanhthi/NoteTheme) for this note. Thank you, [Thi](https://dinhanhthi.com), the author creating the owesome **NoteTheme**. Thanks, the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which
is a blog-aware static site generator in Ruby and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) hosting your website, blog, etc.
